# EDA-for-Telco-Churn-Data

The goal of the data exploration analysis is to understand the forces why customers decided to stop using the service. In my analysis, I have explored:
1. Demography characterictis in relation to churn variable
2. Services used by customers in relation to churn
3. Deep dive into demography characteristics and services to find the reasons to stop using the service

The dataset was taken from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

Note: I was trained as an economist and in a process to understand data better through data science. You can find me in here (https://www.linkedin.com/in/meikha-azzani-813724138/)
